# Supply Chain Shipping Data Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that analyzes supply chain shipping data. By examining shipping trends, delivery times, and other key metrics, this analysis provides insights to optimize logistics and improve overall supply chain efficiency.

## Project Overview

The `Supply_Chain_Shipping_Data_Analysis.ipynb` notebook explores shipping data to understand performance in a supply chain context. Through this analysis, we identify trends and potential bottlenecks, helping businesses make data-driven decisions to enhance shipping operations.

### Objectives
- **Analyze Shipping Trends**: Understand patterns in shipping times, regions, and shipping methods.
- **Identify Bottlenecks**: Spot areas where delays or inefficiencies are common.
- **Optimize Operations**: Provide insights to help reduce delivery times and improve supply chain efficiency.

## Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares shipping data by handling missing values and formatting relevant columns.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Investigates factors like average shipping times, popular shipping methods, and regional differences.
- **Trend Analysis**: Analyzes trends over time to observe any seasonal or regional effects on shipping performance.
- **Visualization**: Uses charts and graphs to highlight key metrics, making it easy to identify trends and issues visually.
